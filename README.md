Problem Statement:
------------------

It's not that we humans only take debts to manage our necessities. A country may
also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is
one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable
lives. [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home) is the organization
that provides debt to countries.

In this project, you are going to analyze international debt data collected by
The World Bank. The data-set contains information about the amount of debt (in
USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. You are going to
find the answers to questions like:

\- What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the
data-set ?  
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look
like ?

\- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt
indicators ?

The data used in this project is provided by [The World
Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home). It contains both national and regional
debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to
2022.
